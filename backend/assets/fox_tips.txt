Fox is incredibly fast and hard to lock down, try not to feel overwhelmed if he's chasing you.
Make sure you tech Fox's shine to make it harder for him to follow up. Missed Techs after Shine will lead to massive damage.
Fox's upsmash out of shield is an incredibly potent combo starter at low percents, and kill confirm at high percents. Use Shinegrab to avoid it.
For increased combo capacity and speed, ensure perfect wavedashes out of shine by being tight with your timings.
