Avoid Marth's grab at low percent, especially on flatter stages and away from platforms, as his chaingrab is devastating.
Near the sides of the stage, be ready to tech Marth's backthrow and down throw, as it can lead to instant death if you miss.
Be careful attacking Marth's shield with unsafe aerials, as his shieldgrab is exceptional. Utilize shine grab to do effective shield pressure.
Make sure you wavedash out of shine after drill and nair to continue the combo and follow up with a grab.
