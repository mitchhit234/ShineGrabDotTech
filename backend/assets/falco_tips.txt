Falco's neutral game revolves around lasers. Mix up what you do after getting hit by one.
Falco's recovery is incredibly poor, knock him off stage, and edgeguard for quick kills.
If you're getting killed by Falco Down Air at the ledge, time a tech properly.
Mix up your DI on Falco's combos, or he gets free punishes on you.
